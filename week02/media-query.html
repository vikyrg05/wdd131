            <h2>1 Nephi 1:1</h2>
            <p>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my
                father; and
                having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the
                Lord in all my
                days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a
                record of my
                proceedings in my days.</p>

            <h2>Alma 1:4</h2>
            <p>And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they
                need not fear nor
                tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had
                also redeemed
                all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.</p>
